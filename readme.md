**CDCRUSH** is a nodeJS CLI tool to compress and restore CD-image based games. It encodes the data and audio tracks with modern codecs resulting in a very small filesize. Then the compressed files can be restored back to a fully usable CD Image.

This is the source code repository. 
[Check out the **NPM** page of the project here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdcrush)
