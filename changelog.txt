CHANGELOG:
----------

V 1.1 
	. Will create a folder as an output dir if no output folder is defined.
	
	. Supports Cue Sheets with multiple track files. Some cuesheets have the tracks 
	  already cut into multiple files and no splitting is required.
	  
	  		  e.g. CueSheets that look like this are now supported:
				  
				FILE "WipEout 3 (USA) (Track 01).bin" BINARY
					TRACK 01 MODE2/2352
					INDEX 01 00:00:00
				FILE "WipEout 3 (USA) (Track 02).bin" BINARY
					TRACK 02 AUDIO
					INDEX 00 00:00:00
					INDEX 01 00:02:00
				FILE "WipEout 3 (USA) (Track 03).bin" BINARY
					..
					..
